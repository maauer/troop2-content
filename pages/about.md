Title: About Chappaqua Troop 2
Slug: about

Chappaqua Troop 2 was founded in 1944. Our current Scoutmaster, Tom Keane, succeeded Francis Landrey as Scoutmaster in 2004. We currently have 27 members, and have had at least 75 members become Eagle Scouts in the past. We meet Wednesday nights at the [First Congregational Church](//fcc-chappaqua.org). Please [contact](/pages/contact.html) our Scoutmaster for more details.
